# Aista Expert AI system

Aista's Expert AI system is a cognitive assistant allowing you to leverage OpenAI's API to query
your own data, creating arguments using ChatGPT. See a screenshot below.

## Features

The system allows you to crawl websites for training data, in addition to importing training
data from PDF files, XML files, CSV files, JSON files and YAML files. The system combines
semantic search with OpenAI's ChatGPT APIs, allowing you to both search through your own
data, in addition to having a _"dialogue"_ with your data, creating compelling arguments,
based upon reasoning and logic.

The system requires authentication and authorisation to access, and hence is intended for
private use within companies and enterprises.

## Use cases

Below are some example use cases.

* Legal assistance
* HR recruiting
* Internal documentation systems
* Any other system requiring AI on private data within a protected environment only allowing access to authorised users
